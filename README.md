# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Model
This project aims to compare different models to predict whether the patient has a heart disease or not. This will be done by using different models such as (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Na√Øve Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors). By evaluating them, the best model will be used to predict the status of the patient.
